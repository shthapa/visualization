# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Good Data Visualization Exmaple
       1.  "Gender pay gap by industry" - from Tableu Public (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/payscale/viz/3-Industry/Dashboard3)
        Why This Is a Good Data Visualization
        The visualization presents the gender pay gap across industries through horizontal bar charts that display data in order of pay gap magnitude. The visualization demonstrates strong qualities because of the following reasons:

       2.  Clarity and Simplicity
        The visualization avoids unnecessary embellishments. The visualization shows median salary differences between men and women through basic bar length measurements. According to Knaflic (2015), simplicity helps viewers focus on the message without distractions.
        
       3.  Use of Color with Purpose
        The designer employs two easily distinguishable yet easy-to-understand colors (blue and orange) to distinguish between genders. The color selection supports accessibility (Ware, 2012) and follows universal design principles especially colorblind-friendliness.
        
        4. Effective Use of Sorting and Labels
        The industries appear in descending order of pay gap so viewers can easily identify which industries show the largest gaps. The placement of data labels beside bars helps users understand the information without mental strain.
    

    Bad Data Visualization 
        Title: "Causes of Death in the US (2020)- https://imgur.com/oc-pie-chart-us-causes-of-death-2020-xx8EaVL
        
        1. Poor Comparability: the many slices make it nearly impossible to perceive differences accurately for smaller categories
        2. Excessive clutter and Categories:Too many categorie and cluttered lablel overlapping text.
        3. Over use of colors: Variety of colros, this not only distract visually but also complicate interpretation.
        4. No Context or Hierachy: No indication of total deaths, not data sources and no narrative.

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
   1. Improve " "Gender pay gap by industry"
    - The addition of interactive features or tooltip functionality would enable users to view additional data points including sample sizes and job positions.
    -    The addition of contextual annotations that highlight government interventions and policy changes would enhance the storytelling capabilities of the visualization.
    
    2. Improve ""Causes of Death in the US (2020)"
     - use sorted bar chart to easy comparisions
     -  reduce categories
     -  simplify color scheme
     -  Enhance labels and context
     -  Add Annotation for emphasis






      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
